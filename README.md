# Easy Way to Manage Secrets in One Place

Fix to the problem of copying environment variables around for mutiple projects.

Simply define them here and access them from anywhere as long as you have AWS credentials.

Furthermore, if host on AWS, you can just give your AWS environment permission to access them.

**UPDATE November 1st, 2025**

I realized that this is not practical because AWS charges ~40 cents per secret per month;
there are likely security benefits that they offer that are of no use to me building personal
projects.
